Hi! I'm Rajesh Kumar Srivastav.

> And **this** is Make A Change.

The Concept of **Make A Change** came into my mind when I was attending a
1-week workshop on *Intervention of behavioural problems in children* in New
Delhi. The psychology changed and a paradigm shift emerged. Since then I have
been conducting staff trainings to make a change around them in schools for
better growth for all stake holders.
